        <p>
          <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If your country has a very high level of control and blocked
          access to many sites, do not work any commercial and free VPN and VPN protocols, we
          recommend using OpenVPN over Cloak from the first connection. If you use unmasked
          protocols, the ip of your VPS can be blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unmasked protocols OpenVPN over UDP, WireGuard and IKEv2 over UDP are easily detected by
          firewalls and some websites. Sites may show a warning: "disable VPN before visiting site".
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this issue, use OpenVPN with the TCP protocol, OpenVPN over ShadowSocks, or
          OpenVPN over Cloak.
        </p>
        <p>In all other cases, the difference between the protocols is minimal.</p>
